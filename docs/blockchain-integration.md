# Blockchain Integration Documentation

This document provides an overview of the blockchain integration components in the Artist Grant AI Agent application.

## Supported Blockchains

The application currently supports the following blockchains:

1. **Base (Coinbase L2)** - An Ethereum Layer 2 solution by Coinbase
2. **zkSync Era** - A ZK-rollup Layer 2 solution with account abstraction
3. **Flow** - A developer-friendly blockchain designed for NFTs and games
4. **Optimism** - An Ethereum Layer 2 solution with Superchain interoperability
5. **Cross-chain** - Integration between multiple blockchains using Chainlink CCIP

## AgentKit Integration

The application integrates with Coinbase's AgentKit to enable AI agents to perform on-chain actions. The integration is implemented through custom action providers for each supported blockchain.

2. **zkSync Action Provider** (`src/lib/blockchain/action-providers/ZkSyncArtistFundActionProvider.ts`)
   - Custom implementation for zkSync Era blockchain
   - Provides actions for grant disbursement and artist details retrieval
   - Successfully deployed and tested on zkSync Era Sepolia testnet
   - Integrated with zkSync Smart Sign-On (SSO) SDK for improved user experience

3. **Flow Action Provider** (`src/lib/blockchain/action-providers/FlowArtistFundActionProvider.ts`)
   - Custom implementation for Flow blockchain
   - Provides actions for artist registration, grant disbursement, and artist details retrieval
   - Uses Flow Client Library (FCL) for blockchain interaction
   - Implements Cadence transactions for contract interaction

4. **Optimism Interop Action Provider** (`src/lib/blockchain/action-providers/OptimismInteropActionProvider.ts`)
   - Enables cross-chain functionality between Base and Optimism
   - Provides actions for L1 block information, system configuration, and token bridging
   - Integrates with Optimism Superchain predeploys for interoperability

#### Flow Integration

The Flow blockchain integration is implemented with the following components:

- **Smart Contract**: `FlowArtistManager.cdc` deployed to Flow testnet at address `0x28736dfc4d9e84c6`

**Note**: The Flow integration with AgentKit is partial because AgentKit primarily supports EVM-compatible chains. Our implementation uses a custom approach to integrate Flow with the agent system.

#### Optimism Interop Integration

The Optimism Superchain interoperability integration is implemented with the following components:

- **Predeploys**: Integration with Optimism's standard predeploys for interoperability

  - `SystemConfig` (0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010)
  - `L2ToL1MessagePasser` (0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000016)
  - `SuperchainTokenBridge` (0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000028)
- **Action Provider**: `OptimismInteropActionProvider.ts` implements the AgentKit action provider interface
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: Supports bridging tokens between Base and Optimism

The Optimism interop integration supports:
- Retrieving L1 block information
- Viewing system configuration
- Initiating withdrawals from L2 to L1
- Bridging tokens between chains
- Viewing aggregated balances across chains
