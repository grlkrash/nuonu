# zkSync SSO Integration Status

This document outlines the current status of the zkSync Smart Sign-On (SSO) integration, including implementation details, encountered issues, and troubleshooting steps.

## Current Implementation

We have integrated the zkSync SSO SDK to provide a seamless wallet connection experience. The implementation includes:

1. **SDK Integration**: Installed and configured the `zksync-sso` package
2. **Connector Setup**: Created a custom connector for zkSync SSO
3. **Session Management**: Implemented session creation and management
4. **UI Components**: Added wallet connection UI components

## Configuration

The zkSync SSO is initialized with the following configuration:

```typescript
// Network configuration
const network = "sepolia";
const rpcUrl = "https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev";
const contractAddress = "0x9A6DE0f62Aa270A8bCB1e2610078650D539B1Ef9";
const chainId = 300;

// Session configuration
const sessionConfig = {
  expiry: "1 day",
  feeLimit: "100000000000000000" // 0.1 ETH
};
```

## Current Issues

We are encountering the following issues with the zkSync SSO integration:

1. **Session Creation Errors**: Errors during the final step of wallet confirmation/creation
2. **Contract Address Warning**: Warning about not using an official zkSync SSO contract address
3. **Connection Flow**: Inconsistent behavior in the wallet connection flow

## Error Messages

The following error messages have been observed:

```
WARNING: Not using an official zkSync SSO contract address. This may cause connection issues.
Current address: 0x0bd1ec565684D5043D0c9aC2835a84A52Ef1Ee41
Expected addresses: {
  sepolia: '0x9A6DE0f62Aa270A8bCB1e2610078650D539B1Ef9',
  testnet: '0x9A6DE0f62Aa270A8bCB1e2610078650D539B1Ef9'
}
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

To resolve the zkSync SSO integration issues, follow these steps:

1. **Verify Contract Address**
   - Update the contract address to match the official zkSync SSO contract address
   - Ensure the network configuration matches the contract address

2. **Check Session Configuration**
   - Verify that the session expiry and fee limit are appropriate
   - Consider reducing the fee limit for testing purposes

3. **Debug Connection Flow**
   - Add detailed logging to the connection process
   - Monitor network requests during the connection attempt
   - Check for any errors in the browser console

4. **Test with Different Wallets**
   - Try connecting with different wallet providers
   - Test with both hardware and software wallets

5. **Update SDK Version**
   - Ensure you're using the latest version of the zkSync SSO SDK
   - Check for any known issues in the SDK documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Update Contract Address**
   - Update the contract address to match the official zkSync SSO contract address
   - Test the connection flow with the updated address

2. **Implement Error Handling**
   - Add specific error handling for common zkSync SSO errors
   - Provide user-friendly error messages

3. **Create Test Script**
   - Develop a dedicated test script for zkSync SSO
   - Test each step of the connection flow independently

4. **Document Workarounds**
   - Document any workarounds for known issues
   - Share findings with the zkSync community
