# AgentKit Implementation for Artist Grant AI Agent

## Overview

This document details our implementation of Coinbase's AgentKit for the Artist Grant AI Agent project. The integration enables our AI agent to perform on-chain actions, manage wallets, and interact with various blockchain networks to facilitate grant distribution and application automation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. AgentKit Integration

We have successfully integrated AgentKit into our application, enabling the following capabilities:

- **Wallet Management**: Secure creation and management of wallets for artists and grant providers
- **On-chain Actions**: Execution of transactions, token transfers, and smart contract interactions
- **Multi-network Support**: Support for Base Sepolia testnet, with planned extensions to zkSync Era and Flow

### 2. Wallet Provider Configuration

We implemented a robust wallet provider configuration using the CDP Wallet Provider:

```javascript
// Configure Coinbase SDK with the JSON file
Coinbase.configure({
  apiKeyName: apiKeyJson.name.split('/').pop(),
  privateKey: apiKeyJson.privateKey
});

// Configure the wallet provider
const config = {
  apiKeyName: apiKeyJson.name.split('/').pop(),
  apiKeyPrivateKey: apiKeyJson.privateKey,
  cdpWalletData: walletDataStr,
  networkId: NETWORK_ID,
};

const walletProvider = await CdpWalletProvider.configureWithWallet(config);
```

### 3. Action Providers

We've implemented multiple action providers to enable various on-chain capabilities:

- **Wallet Action Provider**: For wallet management and ETH transfers
- **ERC20 Action Provider**: For token balance checks and transfers
- **CDP API Action Provider**: For network information and faucet requests
- **CDP Wallet Action Provider**: For wallet-specific operations
- **WETH Action Provider**: For wrapped ETH operations
- **Pyth Action Provider**: For price oracle integration

### 4. Available Actions

Our implementation provides the following actions:

1. **Wallet Details**: Get comprehensive wallet information
2. **Token Balance**: Check ERC20 token balances
3. **Address Reputation**: Evaluate address reputation scores
4. **Faucet Request**: Request test ETH from faucets
5. **Send ETH**: Transfer ETH to other addresses
6. **Gas Price**: Get current gas prices
7. **Transaction History**: View recent transactions

### 5. Integration with Artist Grant Flow

The AgentKit integration is used in our application to:

1. **Fund Distribution**: Automate the distribution of grant funds to artists
2. **Application Automation**: Submit on-chain applications for grants
3. **Wallet Creation**: Create wallets for artists who don't have them
4. **Transaction Monitoring**: Track the status of grant disbursements

## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **CDP Wallet Provider**: Manages wallet creation, storage, and operations
2. **Action Providers**: Enable specific blockchain interactions
3. **AgentKit Instance**: Coordinates between wallet providers and action providers
4. **Wallet Data Storage**: Securely stores wallet information for persistence

### Initialization Flow

1. Load API key from secure storage
2. Initialize Coinbase SDK with API credentials
3. Configure CDP Wallet Provider with network settings
4. Initialize AgentKit with wallet provider and action providers
5. Register available actions for use by the AI agent

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Management**: Secure storage of API keys using environment variables and JSON files
2. **Wallet Data Protection**: Encrypted storage of wallet data
3. **Transaction Signing**: Secure signing process for all transactions
4. **Permission Management**: Strict control over which actions the AI agent can perform

## Testing and Validation

We've created comprehensive test scripts to validate our AgentKit implementation:

1. **Basic SDK Test**: Validates Coinbase SDK configuration
2. **AgentKit Integration Test**: Tests wallet provider and action provider functionality
3. **Comprehensive Demo**: Showcases all available actions and their usage

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-chain Operations**: Implement Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain fund transfers
2. **Smart Contract Automation**: Automate grant contract deployments and interactions
3. **Advanced Action Providers**: Create custom action providers for artist-specific needs
4. **Multi-signature Support**: Implement multi-signature requirements for large grants
