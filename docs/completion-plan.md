## Critical Path Items

The following items are on the critical path and must be completed for a successful submission:

1. Verify/deploy contracts to all testnets
2. Test contract functionality and fix critical bugs
3. Deploy live demo application
4. Complete documentation for each bounty
5. Create demo materials (especially screenshots and videos)
6. Clean up repository and prepare for submission

## Contingency Plan

If time becomes limited, focus on the following:

1. **Must Have (Highest Priority)**
   - Contract deployment and verification for Base and zkSync
   - Live demo deployment with basic functionality
   - Basic testing of contract functionality
   - Essential documentation (README, setup instructions)
   - Repository cleanup
   - Screenshots of key features

2. **Should Have (Medium Priority)**
   - Flow contract deployment
   - Web interface testing
   - Bounty-specific documentation
   - Demo videos for Base and zkSync

3. **Could Have (Lower Priority)**
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Detailed user documentation
   - All demo videos
   - Test accounts for demos

4. **Won't Have (Defer if necessary)**
   - Chainlink CCIP integration
   - Performance optimization
   - Advanced security testing
   - Advanced features not critical for demo

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Contract Deployment Failures**
   - Risk: Deployment to testnets fails or takes longer than expected
   - Mitigation: Prepare mock contracts and screenshots as backup

2. **Integration Issues**
   - Risk: Components don't work together as expected
   - Mitigation: Focus on fixing critical user flows first

3. **Deployment Problems**
   - Risk: Live demo deployment encounters unexpected issues
   - Mitigation: Start deployment early, have fallback options ready (e.g., video walkthrough)

4. **Time Constraints**
   - Risk: Not enough time to complete all tasks
   - Mitigation: Strictly follow the contingency plan priorities

5. **Technical Debt**
   - Risk: Rushing implementation leads to bugs
   - Mitigation: Document known issues transparently

## Team Coordination

- Maintain a shared task board to track progress
- Hold brief check-ins every 4 hours to address blockers
- Assign clear ownership for each major component
- Use pair programming for complex debugging tasks
