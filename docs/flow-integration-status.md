# Flow Integration Status

This document summarizes the current status of the Flow blockchain integration with AgentKit.

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks
- âœ… **Action Provider Implementation**: Created `FlowArtistFundActionProvider` with required functionality
- âœ… **Contract Deployment**: Deployed the ArtistFund contract to Flow testnet at address `0x28736dfc4d9e84c6`
- âœ… **Cadence Script Integration**: Implemented Cadence scripts for interacting with Flow contracts
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for Flow blockchain interactions
- âœ… **Documentation**: Updated blockchain integration documentation with Flow details

### Issues Encountered
- ðŸ”„ **Wallet Connection**: Issues with Flow wallet connection in the browser environment
- ðŸ”„ **FCL Integration**: Challenges with integrating Flow Client Library (FCL) with Next.js
- ðŸ”„ **Test Environment**: Difficulties setting up a consistent test environment for Flow
- ðŸ”„ **AgentKit Integration**: Some issues with the Flow action provider registration in AgentKit

## Next Steps for Flow x AgentKit Integration

1. **Complete Wallet Integration**
   - Implement proper Flow wallet connection using FCL
   - Add support for Blocto and other Flow wallets
   - Test wallet connection flow in the browser environment

2. **Finalize Action Provider Registration**
   - Ensure the Flow action provider is properly registered with AgentKit
   - Verify that the agent can access Flow blockchain functions
   - Test the action provider with real transactions

3. **Create Demo UI Components**
   - Develop Flow-specific UI components for the wallet page
   - Implement transaction history for Flow transactions
   - Add Flow NFT display capabilities

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Create comprehensive test scripts for Flow integration
   - Test all Flow functions through the AgentKit interface
   - Validate error handling and recovery mechanisms

5. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Update documentation with Flow-specific instructions
   - Create example flows for common use cases
   - Document known issues and workarounds

## Future Enhancements

- **Flow NFT Support**: Add support for Flow NFTs and collectibles
- **Multi-signature Support**: Implement multi-signature capabilities for Flow transactions
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Improve metadata handling for Flow assets
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize Flow transaction processing and state management

## Bounty Eligibility

The Flow integration meets the core requirements for the Flow bounty:
- âœ… AI Component with on-chain interaction
- âœ… Smart Contract Integration on Flow testnet
- âœ… Documentation of AI-Flow interaction
- ðŸ”„ Publicly accessible demo (in progress)
- âœ… Usage of Eliza on Flow
- ðŸ”„ AgentKit Integration (partial)

**Overall Status**: 85% Complete

The remaining work focuses on finalizing the demo implementation and ensuring full AgentKit integration.
